# Implement a simple composition of 4 classes: ATM, Client, Card, Bank
#
# Bank(name) + accounts = [] - list of all accounts opened in the current bank
# methods:
#   open_account(client: Client) - takes an instance of Client class as an
# argument and creates a new instance of Card bound to this client (and returns
# it). ! A client can only open one account per bank !
#   close_account(card: Card) - removes specified instance of Card
#
# ATM(bank: Bank, amount: float) - takes an instance of Bank class as an
# argument (the bank this card is bound to) and the amount of money in
# the current ATM.
# methods:
#   withdraw(card: Card, sum: float) - takes two arguments: an instance of
# Card and sum which is needed to be withdrawn. You should consider 2 cases:
#       1) when the amount of money in the bank is less than the sum
#       2) when the ATM and Card are bound to different banks (it shouldn't
# let you withdraw)
#   add(card: Card, sum: float) - add the specified amount of money to the card
#   change_pin(card: Card, old_pin: int, new_pin: int) - change card's pin
#
# Card(account: int, balance: float, pin: str, owner: Client, bank: Bank) -
# account is just a random 5-digit number. Pin is 0000 by default
# methods:
#   transfer_money(card, amount) - transfers the money from the current card to
# the specified one
#
# Client(name: str) + cards = [] - list of cards bound to the client
# methods:
#   show_total_balance - returns the sum of money from all cards owned by the
# client
